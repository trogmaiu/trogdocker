This version the file worked on was images2.php, or better created, 
for its operation other files were created, but another file 
that has its value is passar3.php. It still has to work, it has not 
been tested, but it is already the basis for running. It is necessary 
to create a refresh button, I intend to end this month 
to have a usable version.

To test run image2.php.
